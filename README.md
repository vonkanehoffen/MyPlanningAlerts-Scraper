# MyPlanningAlerts Scraper
## Data acquisition for MyPlanningAlerts app.

Scrapes data from local councils' weekly planning lists.

You'd have thought here would be an API already, hut apparently not... except this one: https://www.landinsight.io/api that costs Â£45 a month.

Hence this.

Create `config.js` using the format in `config.example.js` and you're good to go.

Tested on Node v10.4.1.

Deploy with [PM2](https://pm2.io/), configured in `ecosystem.config.js`. `pm2 start` sets a cron job up to run things weekly.

Logs stored in `log/` with winston. JSON format. Best viewed with something like [json-log-viewer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-log-viewer) I think. `jv logs/combined.log`

Also posts warn level log messages to Slack channel. See hook in config.
