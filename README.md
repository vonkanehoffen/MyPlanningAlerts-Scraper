# MyPlanningAlerts Scraper
## Data acquisition for MyPlanningAlerts app.

Scrapes data from local councils' weekly planning lists.

You'd have thought here would be an API already, hut apparently not... except this one: https://www.landinsight.io/api that costs Â£45 a month.

Hence this.

Create `config.js` using the format in `config.example.js` and you're good to go.

Tested on Node v10.4.1.
